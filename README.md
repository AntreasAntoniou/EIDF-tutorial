# Infk8s Kubernetes Tutorial and Demos

Welcome to an in-depth look at working with Docker and Kubernetes as part of the EIDF GPU Cluster transition guide. This repository serves as a complement to our [YouTube tutorial](https://youtu.be/fzpPtnl7bn0), providing step-by-step walkthroughs for beginners and machine learning enthusiasts wanting to make the most of Docker and Kubernetes.

**Please note that this Tutorial is specific to the `informatics` namespace on the EIDF cluster. It should not be used as guidance by other EIDF customers. The official EIDF userguide and documentation can be found [here](https://epcced.github.io/eidf-docs/services/gpuservice/).**

## Demos

The repository includes four in-depth demos:

1. **Starter Docker Demo**: A beginner-friendly introduction to Docker that covers the basics - perfect if you're new or need a refresher.
2. **Advanced Docker Demo**: A more nuanced Docker tutorial aimed at Machine Learning practitioners. This demo takes you through the creation of Docker containers suitable for ML tasks.
3. **Kubernetes Demo 1**: A straightforward tutorial introducing Kubernetes concepts and demonstrating how to create and manage pods and jobs.
